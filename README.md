# CSPA Technical Steering Committee

The **CSPA Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** is responsible for CSPA exam format, content, and future direction.

Its mission is to create the best possible assessment of software engineers -- one that is useful, up-to-date, and unbiased -- and bridges the gap between education and industry.

## Seats

TSC is composed of 25 representatives from:

- **Education.** Professors, instructors, and curricula administrators from coding schools, MOOCs, and traditional universities. (5 seats)
- **Industry.** Software engineer veterans who have tons of experience hiring as well as a specific area of technical expertise. (15 seats)
- **Open source.** Creators of new technologies -- languages, frameworks, methodologies, etc., and the contributors who maintain them. (5 seats)

## Commitment & Responsibilities

We expect a minimum commitment of 2 hours a month (via Slack).

As a TSC member, you are expected to:

- Join the CSPA TSC Slack group. It will be exclusive to the 25 TSC Committee Members and CSPA.
- Participate in discussions, moderated and led by CSPA. This is will all be done on Slack.
- Contribute to new exam questions. We expect you to come up with at least one good question a month.
